I have uploaded some tiny but useful scripts that I wrote for bash using an ubuntu laptop. These are mainly for educational purposes and may not work for you. I used scripts like this for the same purpose as others use macros. You are welcome to use the code as you wish. Any improvements sent upstream would be welcome.
If you got any questions or suggestions please email me at designbyshelton@gmail.com
