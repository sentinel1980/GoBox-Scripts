I have uploaded some tiny but useful scripts that I wrote for bash, python, and m4 using an ubuntu laptop. These are mainly for educational purposes and may not work for you. I used scripts like this for the same purpose as others use macros. You are welcome to use the code as you wish. Any improvements sent upstream would be welcome. The target enviroment is ubuntu18.04 32bit. Any other enviroment may not work correctly and could cause serious problems. Use at your own risk.
If you have any questions or suggestions please email me at designbyshelton@gmail.com or sentinael1980@yahoo.com. 
I am also on gitlab, and am currently in the process of switching to a non-microsoft owned web-hosting solution for my hobby scripting.
