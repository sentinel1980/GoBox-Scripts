I have uploaded some tiny but useful scripts that I wrote for bash, python, and m4 using an ubuntu laptop. These are mainly for educational purposes and may not work for you. You are welcome to use the code as you wish. Any improvements sent upstream would be welcome. Use at your own risk.
If you have any questions or suggestions please email me at designbyshelton@gmail.com or sentinael1980@yahoo.com.
